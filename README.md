I used imported the data provided in the establishments.json file from the Terminal. Named the database uk_food and the collection establishments. Then I Copied the text used to import the data from my Terminal to a markdown cell in the notebook.

In the notebook, I imported the libraries I needed such as PyMongo and Pretty Print (pprint).

I created an instance of the Mongo Client, confirmed that I created the database and loaded the data properly. I then listed the databases I had in MongoDB and confirmed that uk_food is listed.

I listed the collection in the database to ensure that establishments is there, found and displayed one document in the establishments collection using find_one and used pprint as well.

I assigned the establishments collection to a variable to prepare the collection for use and after updating the Database, I finished with my exploratory analysis.
